## Overview

Developed an opinionated microservices framework in Go that standardizes service development across the organization. The framework provides built-in observability, resilience patterns, and Kubernetes integration, enabling teams to build production-ready services in days instead of weeks.

## Key Features

- gRPC and HTTP/2 support with automatic health checks
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Circuit breakers and rate limiting out-of-the-box
- Prometheus metrics with common SLIs pre-configured
- Structured logging with request correlation
- Kubernetes-native deployment patterns

## Impact

15+ teams adopted the framework, reducing average service development time by 70% while improving reliability and observability.
